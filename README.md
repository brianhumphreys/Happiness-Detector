# Happiness-Detector
Python program that uses cv2 libraries to implement the Viola-Jones Algorithm with a simple method that takes a color frame and a grey-scale frame as an input from a live web-cam

This repository is a first in a series of three that display my understanding of Computer Vision and how different networks create different results of detection.  In this Viola-Jones algorithm, the images are compared to a network with weights that are positioned to the location and frequency of three basic pixel features.
